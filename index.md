## Welcome

Welcome, and thanks for visiting my academic webpage.  
I am an Assistant Professor in Control Engineering at **Trinity College Dublin**, where my research explores how advanced control, optimisation, and learning algorithms can improve the performance, reliability, and sustainability of complex engineering systems.

My work spans model predictive control, reinforcement learning for control, data-driven and adaptive modelling, and distributed control. I’m particularly interested in applications that address global challenges — including renewable and ocean energy, low-carbon mobility, autonomous systems, and intelligent transportation.

I enjoy working with students and collaborators on interdisciplinary, real-world problems, and I welcome anyone interested in these topics to get in touch.
